            <p>with out design domain of being seniors over 75 years old, my team and I ideated aon what we 
                |could possible do and we came up with the idea of creating an app that will help seniors stay
                more connected to their loved ones. We then started to draw sketches to potentially see what
                 this app could look like</p>
        </div>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2><mark>step two:</mark> wireframes</h2>
            <img src="img/kin2.png" style="width: 894px; height: 475px;">
            <p>After having a clear idea of what sort of pages we wanted, each of our team members designed 
                different pages so we could sees what direction we wanted to go in. the following design above 
                was my intial idea that i brought to the group </p>
        </div>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2><mark>step three:</mark> final designs</h2>
            <img src="img/kin3.png" style="width: 894px; height: 475px;">
            <p>after many rounds with meeting with our university professor and teaching assistant, we tweaked 
                our design based on their critiques and made some major changes like the overall color palette 
                and the main feature. in the end, we even prototyped the app to show the interaction points</p>

            <img src="img/plush1.png" style="width: 894px; height: 475px;">
            <p>in this project, we were instructed to code a website for a business that my partner and i had to
                 choose. for our common interest in pokemon, we chose a companyy that would sell merchandise for
                  the brand. after having an inital idea, we worked jointly on a figma page to decide how the page
                  should look like</p>
        </div>

        <div class="steps">
            <h2><mark>step two:</mark> code final site</h2>
            <img src="img/plush2.png" style="width: 894px; height: 475px;">
            <p>finally, after many hours of coding, meeting up to discuss progress, and using a local repository, we 
                ultimately were very happy with the design choices we made and came with a fully functional company 
                site that had a product page, listings, and checkout</p>
